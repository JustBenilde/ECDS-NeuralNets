    "| **Model Architecture**            | 15%                  | Thoughtfully designed with well-placed layers and activations, demonstrating strong understanding. | Well-structured architecture with appropriate layers and activations. | Basic CNN architecture with essential components but minimal customization. | Limited layers or missing key elements like activations or pooling. | Poorly constructed or incomplete architecture affecting functionality. |        |\n",
    "| **Preprocessing & Data Handling** | 15%                  | Comprehensive preprocessing (e.g., normalization, augmentation) with clear justification of choices. | Adequate preprocessing with minor omissions or less variety in techniques. | Basic preprocessing covering essential steps but lacks depth.      | Limited preprocessing; key steps like normalization or augmentation are missing. | No meaningful preprocessing, leading to poor data handling.          |        |\n",
    "| **Evaluation Metrics Interpretation** | 20%                  | Deep and insightful interpretation of metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score), explaining their relevance to the classification task. | Good interpretation of key metrics with reasonable explanations for their impact. | Basic interpretation focusing on one or two metrics with moderate understanding. | Limited interpretation with unclear or shallow understanding of evaluation metrics. | No interpretation of metrics or incorrect explanations.              |        |\n",
    "| **Analysis of Results & Insights** | 25%                  | Thorough analysis, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and providing actionable improvement suggestions. | Good analysis with general insights and reasonable improvement suggestions. | Basic analysis identifying strengths or weaknesses with limited detail. | Limited analysis with unclear or superficial insights into model performance. | No analysis or incorrect conclusions drawn from results.             |        |\n",
    "| **Presentation & Data Storytelling**  | 25%                  | Clear, engaging, and well-organized presentation, with strong focus on explaining results and insights in a compelling way. | Good presentation with clear explanations and focus on interpreting results. | Basic presentation, clear but lacks depth or engaging storytelling.            | Presentation lacks clarity or storytelling focus; minimal engagement. | Poor presentation with minimal explanation or incorrect interpretation of results. |        |\n",
